**Background**\
Museum, Library, Archive and other information technologies are a set of
expansive domains. While we\'ll cover a variety of essential elements,
there\'s a great deal of depth we won\'t be able to get to during class
time together.

Moreover, technology, more so than many other areas within the
information professions, is subject to an increasingly rapid pace of
upheaval. What was considered a staple consumer technology or
professional service just a few years ago may now be fading in
importance, or worse, obsolete. For these reasons and others, keeping
current with emerging issues and technologies is something that will be
required of all people working in all information professions.

The class blog is an opportunity for students to direct their additional
readings and media observation in a direction of their choosing in order
to supplement more specific interests and tracks/programs within Pratt
SI. For example, students interested in digital preservation issues may
wish to focus their posts on current preservation concerns, while a
student in the Information Experience Design track may wish to focus on
trends in usability testing.

Technology & Service Inspiration Posts
======================================

Students will contribute at least three short posts to the class blog
over the course of the semester. See the syllabus and class blog for a
non-exhaustive list of potential sources for fodder.

These are meant to be brief annotated citations of services. Students
should search professional literature sources as well as news sources
and other media for examples---large or small---that relate to the use
of technology in the provision of service. They can be citations of
innovative services currently being offered by libraries, archives, or
museums, or examples from other industries that could potentially be
applied to information profession environments. Examples can range from
"soft technology" --- e.g., social media, smartphone apps, etc. --- to
more granular and complex technology examples, like Application
Programming Interfaces (APIs), scripting tools, information
visualization applications, etc.

**Technology & Service Inspiration Posts Requirements**

-   150-word minimum (original post content; not including excerpt or
    citation, etc.)
-   Published to class blog by the time class starts on the due date
    -   With descriptive title
    -   Categorizes appropriately, e.g., Technology & Service
        Inspiration Post 1, Technology & Service Inspiration Post 2,
        etc.
    -   Tagged with relevant keywords
    -   Use only the "standard" post format option
-   Excerpt or embed of source material
    -   Includes citations of any source material, with links embedded
        if possible
-   Brief comment about why the cited example is of interest, and how it
    is being or could be deployed in an information profession context
    -   Addresses, briefly, at least the following questions:
        -   What is new and/or noteworthy here?
        -   Why should people in the information fields be paying
            attention to this particular development?

 **Reflection Posts**
=====================

Students will contribute at least three significant posts to the class
blog over the course of the semester. Ask in class or outside of class if you need initial topic suggestions, and see the syllabus and class blog for a non-exhaustive list of potential sources.

The posts should be a minimum of 700 words in length, and must include:
an excerpted portion (**not** to be included in the word count) or embed
(with Fair Use criteria in mind; see below) and direct link to the
source; a brief summary or explanation of the material with comment on
how the material was discovered; and the student\'s reflection, drawing
connections and parallels to material covered in class and/or ongoing
concerns to the various information profession communities.

**Reflection Posts Requirements**

-   700-word minimum (original post content; not including excerpt or
    citation, etc.)
-   Published to class blog by the time class starts on the due date
    -   With descriptive title
    -   Categorizes appropriately, e.g., Reflection Post 1, Reflection
        Post 2, etc.
    -   Tagged with relevant keywords
    -   Use only the "standard" post format option
-   Excerpt or embed of source material
    -   Includes citations of any source material, with links embedded
        links if possible
-   Brief summary or explanatory remarks about source material
-   Reflection on material in context of class topics and larger
    information professions discussions
    -   Addresses at least the following questions:
        -   How are the sources under consideration in the post deeply
            relevant to the information science profession?
        -   How does this tie to larger technology trends or
            implications?
        -   Why should people in information fields be paying attention
            to this particular development?
-   **At least two** concluding questions that prompt further consideration of the topic

**Note on writing style/tone:**

Write what feels comfortable, and helps you get your point across.

No need to be overly formal as long as what you write is expressed
clearly and effectively.

If it helps you frame your posts, feel free to consider your audience to
be both me and your class peers, eager to hear from the periodic updates
on relevant materials you've discovered in the course of this class.

Meanwhile, I also suggest that you consider re-publishing the posts you
write for this class in other places, such as your own blog, on
Medium.com, or elsewhere. They can be great fodder as writing samples,
especially if you consider that kind of re-use ahead of time.

Appendix: On Fair Use
=====================

Fair use is an extremely important facet of the information industry,
and is an essential component of the law to understand and be able to
clearly communicate to patrons, researchers, students, and anyone else
who might benefit from fair use.

17 U.S. Code ยง 107 - Limitations on exclusive rights: Fair use
--------------------------------------------------------------

<http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107>

> Notwithstanding the provisions of sections
> [106](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106) and
> [106A](http://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/106A), the fair use
> of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or
> phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for
> purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching
> (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or
> research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether
> the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the
> factors to be considered shall include---
>
> (1) **the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;**
> 
> (2) **the nature of the copyrighted work;**
> 
> (3) **the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and**
> 
> (4) **the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.**

---

The following are the best and most succinct informal criteria for fair
use I've heard:

1.  *Are you using the material to illustrate a specific point that
    you're trying to make?*

2.  *Are you only using so much as is necessary to make that point?*

3.  *Is it clear to the audience what that point is?*
