# Break!

---
# Before we get started

This class is a lot of questions to you all, and meant to be more discussion-based.

Don't hesitate to stop me to ask about terms, and connections, and more.

---
# Ethics

--
What even are ethics?!


---

# Ethics


Ethics are essentially rules and principles that get at **values** ‚Äì they are expressions that are meant, at root, to describe what is right, what is wrong, and how to differentiate between the two

---
# Ethics

- What are examples of ethics at play in daily life?
- How do these manifest in our experiences?
- Where and how do they come up?

---
# Ethics

What are examples of ethical frameworks explicitly built into professional fields?

--
- How do these manifest?
- How are they enforced?

Any examples from the fields in which people have worked?

---
# Ethics

The big question:
Why don't these seem to be working in many technology contexts?

---

## What are examples of ethics in the info fields?

--
- Library ethics?

--

- Archival ethics?

--

- Museum ethics?

--

- UX/Design ethics?

--
- Software developer ethics?


---
# Open Source

What does it mean for something to be "open source"?

Let's jot these aspects down in our notes.

--
- Which of these are just part of the technical meaning of "open source"?

--
- Which of these align with the moral/ethical aspects of "open source"?

---

# Open Source

The groupings Christie Koehler devised are useful:

--
- ‚ÄúProprietary‚Äù software
- Free software
- Open source software
- Public domain software

---

# Open Source

What are some examples of Open Source projects?

--

What about at different scales:

- Infrastructure
- Enterprise
- Personal computing
- Other?


---

# Open Source

Open Source as a means of visibility into projects:
https://www.openhub.net/

---

# Copyright

So, what is "public domain"?

---

# Copyright

Before we dive into intellectual property, a few bigger questions:

--
- What's the difference between ethics and the law?

---

# Copyright

So what is Copyright?

`The exclusive right to make copies and distribute copies of intellectual property.`

--

So what is `intellectual property`?


--
- What do you have to do to claim copyright?

--
- Can copyright be transferred?

--
- Does it last forever?


---
# Copyright

What happens if you can't distinguish between:
- The right to make copies of a work, and

--
- The right to distribute a work?

---

# First Sale Doctrine and Fair Use

## A seemingly simple question

Can you own an ebook?

---

# First Sale Doctrine and Fair Use

Before we answer that, does anyone have a "real" book* lying around, from a major publisher?

<small>\* (or, as I like to call these, "hardcopy PDFs")</small>

See anything on the copyright page?

---

# First Sale Doctrine and Fair Use


An example from a real book:

> _No part of this publication may be reproduced or transmitted in any form or by any means, electronic or mechanical, including photocopy, recording, or any information storage and retrieval system, without permission in writing from the publisher._

---

# What are First Sale, and Fair Use?

They are (incredibly important!) exceptions to the exclusive rights held by copyright owners.

First Sale ([17 U.S. Code ¬ß 109a](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/109)):
> _"Notwithstanding the provisions of section 106 (3), the owner of a particular copy or phonorecord lawfully made under this title, or any person authorized by such owner, is entitled, without the authority of the copyright owner, to sell or otherwise dispose of the possession of that copy or phonorecord."_

---

# What are First Sale, and Fair Use?

## So why is First Sale important? 

---

# What are First Sale, and Fair Use?

Fair Use ([ 17 U.S. Code ¬ß‚ÄØ107](https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/107)):

> *Notwithstanding the provisions of sections 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106 and 17 U.S.C. ¬ß 106A, the fair use of a copyrighted work, including such use by reproduction in copies or phonorecords or by any other means specified by that section, for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching (including multiple copies for classroom use), scholarship, or research, is not an infringement of copyright. In determining whether the use made of a work in any particular case is a fair use the factors to be considered shall include:*
>
> - the purpose and character of the use, including whether such use is of a commercial nature or is for nonprofit educational purposes;
> - the nature of the copyrighted work;
> - the amount and substantiality of the portion used in relation to the copyrighted work as a whole; and
> - the effect of the use upon the potential market for or value of the copyrighted work.

---

# First Sale

Let's look at a real example of where this comes up in the real world.

Our example -- the **Amazon Kindle Terms of Use**:

https://www.amazon.com/gp/help/customer/display.html?nodeId=201014950

(There are millions of other examples like this out in the world, but this one is clear and straight-forward)

# Copyright and Ethics

Now that we've gone through all of those things:

- What's the connection between copyright and ethics?

---

# Copyright and Ethics

Let's go back to our two biggest questions of this class:

- What's the difference between ethics and the law?

--
- What's the difference between ethics and justice?
