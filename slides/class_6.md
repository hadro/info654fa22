# Readings

---



Where are we starting today?  

--
What's the connection to information professions? 

--

# Empathy

--
And that's a huge part of why UX and accessibility are so tightly connected to the information professions. 
---
## Some definitions 

**Usability:** 
--
‚Äúease of use and learnability of a human-made object‚Äù, in other words, intuitiveness, familiarity, etc.  
  
--
**User Experience:** 
--
‚Äúconcept that places the end-user at the focal point of design and development efforts, as opposed to the system, its applications or its aesthetic value alone. It's based on the general concept of user-centered design.‚Äù  

--
**Web Accessibility:** 
--
‚ÄúWeb accessibility means that the Web is designed so that people with disabilities can perceive, understand, navigate, and interact with it effectively, as well as create and contribute content to the Web.‚Äù

## Growing and evolving

These elements are not static!
They are indeed pulled in (at least) two directions:
- General user expectations and familiarity
- Advances in technology and tooling

---

## What are the roots of modern web accessibility guidelines? 

- [Americans with Disabilities Act (1990)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Americans_with_Disabilities_Act_of_1990)
- [Section 508 Amendment to the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (1998)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_508_Amendment_to_the_Rehabilitation_Act_of_1973)


---

## What does Section 508 cover?

- Applies, strictly speaking, only to federal agencies and federally funded activities/programs
- But, more importantly, it sets broad and national standards for what minimal accessibility should be  
--
  

"Under Section 508 (29 U.S.C. ¬ß 794d), agencies must give disabled employees and **members of the public access to information that is comparable to the access available to others**."  

--
  
What does "comparable" mean in this legislation?  

---

## Four major categories of Accessibility
- ### Visual
- ### Hearing
- ### Motor 
- ### Cognitive


---

## Key provisions
- Provide text alternatives for image-based media
- Provide alternatives for time-based media
- Offer adaptable design
- Offer navigable design
- Offer distinguishable design (foreground and background)

-- 

## Out in the field

What are examples of sites that handle accessibility well?

What about offline? Are there examples that come to mind?

## Accessibility validator

Give this a try with your favorite website, and see if it passes accessibility validation. 


---
# User research methods (among others)

- Surveys
- Focus groups 
- Interviews
- Web analytics
- Field studies


---
# Personas

A fictional representation of a user, particularly one who embodies essential traits and behaviors reflected in real user populations.  

They can be idealized, but the idea is to attach real and human qualities to design goals and design thinking.
