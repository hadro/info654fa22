# Technologies

Important technologies that make up the web:

- hypertext
- domain name system
- browsers

---

# Hypertext

- inspired by the "memex" concept
- jumping from text to text, creating links
- WWW brought hypertext to a global scale

## History of Hypertext

- See: Vannevar Bush's [As We May Think](https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true) (1945)
- See: Douglas Engelbart and Team's [Mother of All Demos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B6rKUf9DWRI) (1968)
- See: Apple Macintosh's [HyperCard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HyperCard)

(Don't miss archived HyperCard collections on Archive.org, e.g. <https://archive.org/details/hypercard_twin-peaks>)

# HTML

.center[![](./img/spingreenguy.gif)]

---
# HTML

- Needed to convey information over the internet
- neutral way of writing that can be read by any application
- based on SGML (Standard Generalized Mark-up Language)
- a sibling to XML (eXtensible Mark-up Language)
  - Essentially, a stricter subset of possible XML markups
- was created for sharing documents

(Fun fact from your readings: since HTML was designed for sharing 1980s physics papers, whether to include images or not was hotly debated. Can you fathom a WWW without pictures of cats?)

---

# HTML

Separating **Document Structure** from *Style*

--

Why is this necessary? Why develop it this way?

---

# HTML5

- Like all languages, HTML has changed over time
- Some things go away:
  - `<blink></blink>`
  - `<marquee></marquee>`
- Another example of the web changing: [Seasonal Restoration](https://blog.geocities.institute/archives/6620)
- Many new attributes are added to make the web easier to view
- expanded to handle more than just documents

# before we dive in

--

## Let's look at code

---

Because the Web is built on open standards...

All the source code is there for you to view!

Your new best friend: "View Source"

### Chrome
View -> Developer -> View Source

### Firefox
Tools -> Browser Tools -> Page Source

<https://neilpatel.com/blog/how-to-read-source-code/>

---

## Spend a minute looking at code!

![](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/blog/sci-fi-fantasy/wp-content/nas-uploads/sites/4/2019/09/matrix.png)

Find a page you visit frequently, and use the "view source" tool to look at the underlying HTML.

What do you notice? Do you see anything interesting?

## Building blocks: HTML Elements


---

# What is an 'element'?

Two options, both in meta-code:

**`<element attribute="value"> content that the element wraps around</element> `**

(more common)

or

**`<element attribute="value"> `**

(Less common, called a self-closing tag or element)

---

# Let's learn some real HTML elements

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
	    <title>The title in the browser tab</title>
    </head>
    <body>
	    <h1>My page heading</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

---
# HTML

## `<html></html>`

- holds everything together
- The "spine" of all nested elements

---
# Head and Body

## `<head></head>`
## `<body></body>`

---
# Head

```html
<head>
	<title>Information in your browser tab</title>
	<meta charset="utf-8">
	<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="//fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans" />
</head>
```
---
# Body

```html
<body>
	<h1>Everything you see on the page</h1>
	<p>Everything you see on the page will go in the body of the HTML</p>
</body>
```

---
# Heading tags

```html
<h1></h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3></h3>
<h4></h4>
<h5></h5>
<h6></h6>
```

--
# An `h1` heading
## An `h2` heading
### An `h3` heading
#### An `h4` heading
etc.


---
# HTML5 Semantic elements

```html
<header></header>
<nav></nav>
<aside></aside>
<footer></footer>
```
... and [more](https://guide.freecodecamp.org/html/html5-semantic-elements/)

# Tables
(spreadsheets on the web)

<table style="border:4px solid black;font-size:1.4em;">
  <tr>
    <td style="border:4px solid darksalmon">Row 1, column 1</td>
    <td style="border:4px solid darksalmon">Row 1, column 2</td>
    <td style="border:4px solid darksalmon">Row 1, column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td style="border:4px solid green">Row 2, column 1</td>
    <td style="border:4px solid green">Row 2, column 2</td>
    <td style="border:4px solid green">Row 2, column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>

---
# Tables

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 1, column 1</td>
    <td>Row 1, column 2</td>
    <td>Row 1, column 3</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Row 2, column 1</td>
    <td>Row 2, column 2</td>
    <td>Row 2, column 3</td>
  </tr>
</table>
```

# Lists

```html
<ul>
	<li>List item in an unordered list</li>
	<li>Another list item</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>List item in an ordered list</li>
	<li>List item 2</li>
</ol>
```

---
# Lists, rendered

<ul>
	<li>List item in an unordered list</li>
	<li>Another list item</li>
</ul>
<ol>
	<li>List item in an ordered list</li>
	<li>List item 2</li>
</ol>

---
# Comments

## `<!-- This is an HTML comment -->`

When this appears in the code, anything between the `<!--` and the next `-->` won't actually get rendered by the browser (it stays in the code).

--
```html
<p>Text goes here</p>
<!-- Whatever I put here only shows up in the code as a comment like this -->
<p>Rendered text continues here</p>
<!-- HTML comments don't get rendered by the browser -->
<p>Third graf</p><!-- they can be inline also -->

```

--
## Renders in a browser like this: 

Text goes here  
Rendered text continues here  
Third graf

# Elements and Attributes

- Everything we just covered were HTML **elements**
  + (basically, everything with the angle brackets `<`  `>`)
- Elements can have **attributes**
- Attributes are "key-value pairs" that fit inside HTML elements
- Attributes are what make the Web work! It's what Vannevar Bush got super excited about, the "mesh of associative trails"
- The next few pages are examples

---
# Linking

```html
<a href="https://www.w3.org/">Link text</a>
```

- `a` is the HTML element (the "anchor" element)
- `href` is the attribute (the "**h**ypertext **ref**erence")
- the website is the value of the attribute

--

# The markup above rendered:

### <a href="https://www.w3.org/">Link text</a>

---
# Embedding images

## `<img src="/assets/greenguy.gif">`

- `img` is the HTML element
- `src` ("source") is the attribute
- the path to where the image is is `src`'s value
- Note that this is an example of one of the few "self-closing" elements

---
# Embedded images and ALT text

`<img src="/assets/greenguy.gif" alt="rotating alien">`

- `alt` is the HTML attribute for images that provide screenreaders with a brief decsription of the word, or show up when the image itself cannot load

---
Here's an example of what that looks like:

--

With a good URL: <img src="./img/spingreenguy.gif" alt="rotating alien" title="rotating alien" />  
    

--
With a broken URL: <img src="./img/intentionallybadlink.gif" alt="'alt' text describing the rotating alien image" title="'alt' text describing the rotating alien image" />

---
# What about that DOCTYPE?

`<!DOCTYPE html>`

- "document type declaration"
- lets the computer know what kind of file this is, even though your browser can probably guess

---
# ...and more!

There are many more elements and aspects to HTML than covered here; this is just an overview of some of the major concepts.

---

---
# Things to remember

- Most HTML elements need an "opening" and "closing" tags.
- The exception to this is if they are "self-closing" (for elements that don't need any text content in between, like `img` or `br`)

---
# Cheat sheets

Use these to help remember syntax and rules!

# HTML exercise

There are great tools out there that let you write HTML and see in real-time what it looks like.

One we like is called <https://repl.it/> (works with many programming languages)

(Glitch is another popular one, with similar functionality: <https://glitch.com/>)

---

# HTML exercise

Remember the first webpage ever?

--

Here's the URL: <http://info.cern.ch/hypertext/WWW/TheProject.html>

Funny enough, the HTML on that page is actually no longer valid!

As a quick exercise, using the <Repl.it> tool from the previous slide, try using the following elements to recreate the first few lines of that web page in current valid html:
- H1: `<h1>Heading here</h1>`
- Paragraph: `<p>Paragraph text here.</p>`
- Anchor: `<a href="URL_here">Link text</a>`
