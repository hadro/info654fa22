# Syllabus

The canonical version of the syllabus lives in our class Github repository:
[INFO 654-04 Syllabus](https://hadro.github.io/info654fa22/syllabus/)

--
## We'll go section by section

---

## Note

Before we get to the syllabus, a quick note:

I come from a library/archives background.

But when I say "library", that doesn't always just mean library -- for the most part, I mean GLAM and information professions more broadly!

(We'll make it clear when we mean libraries/archives/museums/UX roles as completely distinct)

---

## One part of class philosophy:

You are entering a set of professions. we're not training you to be network admins or coders per se, but rather good professional colleagues in these professions who are totally and completely conversant in the languages of technology. That means being able to talk to peers and colleagues and end users about any and all relevant technology issues.

And, as you'll see this semester, this notion of "technology" really infuses every aspect of daily life, professional and personal.

---

## Class Norms

This isn't all a one-way street.
You have as much to learn from your peers and colleagues in this class as you do from us (maybe more, over the long-term!)

While the assignments, other than the presentation assignment, don't require group work or co-working, we'll try to make this work during the lab sections of the class, and we encourage you to use Slack and other spaces to make connections with your peers.
