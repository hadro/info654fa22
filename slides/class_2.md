Thoughts? Reactions? Suprises?

class: center, middle

# Networks

--

[Original [info + slides by Ashley Blewer](https://training.ashleyblewer.com/presentations/networks.html)]

---
# Networks

- protocols
- infrastructure
- the Internet

---

## But first

--

I want you to stare at the bottom left corner of your web browser, then hit refresh.
Do this a couple of times.

--

What do you see when you do this?

---
# Networks

A network is two or more devices that are connected together, and are able to communicate or share resources with each other. I like this picture because the firewall is on fire for some reason.

---
## Never forget

... this all literally started as a sci-fi dream:

--

## **`"Galactic Network"`**


---

# What is the Internet?

--

> "Internet" refers to the global information system that -- (i) is logically linked together by a globally unique address space based on the Internet Protocol (IP) or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons; (ii) is able to support communications using the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite or its subsequent extensions/follow-ons, and/or other IP-compatible protocols; and (iii) provides, uses or makes accessible, either publicly or privately, high level services layered on the communications and related infrastructure described herein

---

## What's the difference between:
- "The Internet"
- "The World Wide Web"

?

---
# Protocols

This communication can happen because of established rules and standards around the sending of data.

--

## What are some examples of protocols you may have come across?

--

Shout 'em out!

---


Some common protocols for networking are:

- TCP/IP
- FTP (sending files)
- SMTP (email)
- HTTP
- Wi-Fi
- Bluetooth
- LTE

# TCP/IP

**TCP**: Transmission Control Protocol  
**IP**: Internet Protocol


<img src="./img/survived-tcp.jpg" alt="tcp-ip pin" width="35%" />
---
# TCP/IP
It is a set of rules that govern how data is transferred over the internet.  

TCP/IP was standardized via the [Internet Engineering Task Force](https://www.ietf.org/), and in fact the organization itself was established in order to properly identify and formalize TCP/IP as a standard.

---
# Introduction to TCP/IP

The 4-Layer Model (4m32s)

allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

---
# The 4 layers

- Application layer (sends information to transport layer)
- Transport (TCP) layer (breaks packets down, ensures reliable byte stream)
- Internet (IP) layer (pair each packet to proper IP destination)
- Link layer (sends packets between IP and hosts)

---
# HTTPS?

HTTPS is a protocol developed on top of HTTP that takes extra steps to ensure security, privacy, and integrity of the communication channel between you and the website.  

![](./img/computerhorsepics.gif)

Why is this such a big deal?

---
# WireShark (We'll come back to this at the end)

Use [WireShark](https://www.wireshark.org/) to understand your surroundings.

What is WireShark?  

> "Wireshark is the world‚Äôs foremost and widely-used network protocol analyzer. It lets you see what‚Äôs happening on your network at a microscopic level and is the de facto (and often de jure) standard across many commercial and non-profit enterprises, government agencies, and educational institutions." [source: website](https://www.wireshark.org/)

# IP Addresses
## (The "IP" part of TCP/IP)

This is an IP Address:

<http://173.194.221.139>

--

Computers can understand it ...

humans not so much.

---

IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4)  

32 bit  

4,294,967,296 possible addresses (2^32, or 256 \* 256 \* 256 \* 256)

Why is this a problem?

---
Enter IPv6

128-bit address

... or approximately 3.4√ó10^38 addresses

---
## So how do humans engage with this IP system effectively?


---
# Distributed Name Service (DNS)

What does this do?

.center[![](./img/dnsbutton.gif)]

---
# Distributed Name Service (DNS)

- gives human-readable names to IP addresses
- lets people have simple email addresses
- gives us domain names (.com, .net, .club)

.center[![](./img/dnsbs.gif)]


---

## Uniform Resource Locators (URLs)

--

In meta-description:

#### `scheme://subdomain.domain.TopLevelDomain:port/path?query_string#fragment_id`

--
E.g.

Query string: <https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/1945/07/as-we-may-think/303881/?single_page=true>

Fragment ID:
<https://prattsi654fa22.vercel.app/#4>


---

## What are some of the most common TLDs?

--

## What are other more exotic TLD options?


---

# HTTP Status codes

HTTP status codes are how our browsers know whether resources are where the URL says they should be.

--

They handle a variety of critical scenarios:
- Resources have changed addresses (think: automatic redirects)
- A user doesn't have permission to see a certain resources (think: pages that require login)
- A server is unable to deliver the resource, even though the address is accurate (think: someone's site is down entirely)

---

## HTTP status codes come in "series"
- 200 series
- 30x series
- 40x series
- 50x series

---

## OK 200

The request was fulfilled

--

> Note: you'll basically never actually "see" this code in the application layer -- it means the request worked as expected!

---

## Redirection 3xx

E.g., 301 redirect means "Moved permanently"

http://si.pratt.edu

TO

https://www.pratt.edu/academics/information/


---

## Then there are the errors:
- USER ERRORS (400 series)
- SERVER ERRORS (500 series)

---

## Unauthorized 401
--

## Forbidden 403
--

## Not found 404

--

<pre>HTTP response codes for dummies.
50x: we screwed up.
40x: you screwed up.
30x: ask that dude over there.

# People make networks

Not everything has to be super technical, there is a very large and chaotic "people" layer when it comes to computer networks.
